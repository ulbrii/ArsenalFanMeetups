# Intro

For my second React project, I wanted to showcase a little bit more of an extensive knowledge of the framework, and test myself as best I could.  I created this meetup site where fans can set up and organize gatherings at different locations and times, with whatever unique images they wanted to upload to their post.  Also added a favorite functionality so that they can keep track of the get-togethers they are specifically interested in.   As an avid Premier League fan—namely an Arsenal die-hard—I thought this would be a fun project to work on :)
